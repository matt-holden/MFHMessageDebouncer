# MFHMessageDebouncer

This is an Objective-C implementation of a method debouncer. You can
read more about deboucing [here](http://unscriptable.com/2009/03/20/debouncing-javascript-methods/).

MFHMessageDebouncer is available through [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org). To install
it, simply add the following line to your Podfile:

    pod "MFHMessageDebouncer"

#Usage

You have the option of:

1. Debouncing all message to an object, or 
2. Debounce all message to *any* object originating at a specific call
site (not yet available in Swift):

### 1:

```objc
NSTimeInterval delayLength = 1.0;
NSMutableArray *myArray = [NSMutableArray array];

for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
    [myArray addObject:@(i)];
}

// One second (delayLength) later, myArray will hold a single element, the number 3.
// The `addObject:` message was only sent to myArray a single time
```

### 2:  (pulled straight from the unit tests)

```objc

// Make three mutable arrays
NSArray *arrayInstances = @[[NSMutableArray new], [NSMutableArray new], [NSMutableArray new]];

NSTimeInterval delay = 1.0;
for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
  // Debounce any message sent from this specific call site, regardless
  // of the receiver or message name
  [MFHDebouncedCallSite(arrayInstances[i], delay) addObject:@(i)];
}

// .... one second later, 
// Only the last object that was messaged will have received 'addObject:'
[arrayInstances[0] count] == 0;  //true
[arrayInstances[1] count] == 0;  //true
[arrayInstances[2] count] == 1;  //true
[arrayInstances[2] objectAtIndex:0] == @3;  //true
```
